Avoiding Common Attacks
Measures taken to avoid common attacks:


Contract uses K.I.S.S principles and ideas. Is meant just for simple verification and proof.

The only function that writes to the blockchain is notarize leaving the vulernability of losing money at a very low risk.

There are no recursive calls and no external calls to avoid possible reentrancy issues.

Contract owner only has privledge to get proof using the proof contract. This is so only the contract owner can see their own proofs.
